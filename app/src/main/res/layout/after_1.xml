Are we care about your health, we advise you to read and follow these instructions.
1- Keep laying on donation chair for 5 minutes then stand up slowly, and donâ€™t leave the donation area before being released by your attending nurse.
2- You are welcomed in our refreshment area. The resting period of 15 minutes after blood donation is actually the time to observe you for any possible donor juice before reactions.
3- Drink your juice before leaving. It is important to drink extra fluids in the first 4 hours following donation. Increase fluid intake for the next 3 days to help you restore your body fluid.
4- You should eat iron rich food for the next few days after donation.
5- Do not smoke for the next two hours.
6- Keep your bandage dry and in place for the next 4 hours. If bleeding occurs from vein puncture site, raise your arm above your head and apply moderate pressure to the bleeding site until it stops and replace bandage for additional 4 hours.
7- Avoid heavy lifting strenuous exercise, and hazardous work (e.g construction workers,  Truck drivers of heavy machine operators) for 12 hours. This will help to prevent bruising, improve healing of the needle puncture site, and allowing your body to compensate for the blood loss.
